# TODO

- Add a logger to log API requests and responses

- Implement a browser for auto detecting token

- Separate CSS and make it SCSS

- minimize refreshToken

- Feedback Mechanisms: Provide visual feedback for long-running tasks. For example, show a loading spinner or a progress bar when making API calls.

- Modularize Your Code: Breaking down your code into more modular components can help improve manageability and reusability. For instance, handling API requests and UI updates could be more clearly separated.

- Use Environment Variables: For API URLs and any other sensitive or configurable data, use environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your source files.
